# covid-estimators
This is a non-software github site. This is used to track different covid-estimators and uses of the estimators.

Anyone can submit a suggested change and then initiate a "Pull Request". That triggers a review by the moderators to approve the change.

Alternatively, things can be discussed in the Issue Tracker.

## Associated site
This is the github associated with https://covidestimators.org/. That's a more standard "website" and blog. This github is for discussions and research/tracking.

Github is great because everything is time-stamped and tracked and easy to search.


# Dedication
May covid-estimators be of benefit to all. May you be healthy and safe.
