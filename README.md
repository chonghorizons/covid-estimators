# covid-estimators
This is a non-software github site. This is used to track different covid-estimators and uses of the estimators.

Please see the https://github.com/chonghorizons/covid-estimators/wiki (WIKI) for discussion of key parameters or to add your own information about key parameters.
You are welcome to make changes to the Wiki. Ask for access.

Things can be discussed in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/chonghorizons/covid-estimators/issues) and you do not need to be approved to raise an issue.

## Associated site
This is the github associated with https://covidestimators.org/. That's a more standard "website" and blog. This github is for discussions and research/tracking.

Github is great because everything is time-stamped and tracked and easy to search.


# Dedication
May covid-estimators be of benefit to all. May you be healthy and safe.
